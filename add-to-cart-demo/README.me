# Add to Cart - React + Vite Demo

This is a simple project to practice **Add to Cart** functionality using React and Vite.

---

## Introduction

- Add products to the cart  
- View all items added  
- Remove items  
- Clear the cart

Using Redux Toolkit, all cart-related state will be **globally available**, avoiding complex component hierarchies or prop-drilling.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Integrate React components with **Redux Toolkit**  
- Implement key E-Commerce features:
- Add to cart  
- Remove from cart  
- Clear cart  
- Compose multiple React components into a single UI  
- Use **Redux state** globally across the app

---

## Prerequisites

To succeed in this lab, you should be familiar with:

- Basic knowledge of **React** and component composition  
- Intermediate-level **JavaScript**  
- Functional components and the `useState` hook in React  
- Fundamentals of **Redux Toolkit** (createSlice, store, etc.)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to create a new React + Vite project and use this code.

### Create a new Vite + React project

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-cart-app --template react
```

> Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn create vite my-cart-app --template react
```

Then move into your project:

```bash
cd my-cart-app
```

---

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

> Or

```bash
yarn install
```

---

### Replace `src` folder

Delete the existing `src` folder in the newly created Vite project.

Then copy-paste the provided `src` folder from this repository into your Vite project root.

---

### Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## Done!

Your Add to Cart demo should now be running locally on `http://localhost:5173`.
