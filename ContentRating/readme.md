## Overview

The **ContentRating** component is a simple interactive React component that allows users to rate content by clicking **Like** or **Dislike** buttons. This is a hands-on lab project designed to practice React state handling and user interaction in a clean, functional UI.

When the component is rendered for the first time, both the like and dislike counts are set to zero. Clicking the **Like** or **Dislike** button increases the respective count by one.

##  Features

- Tracks likes and dislikes using React state
- Updates count in real-time when buttons are clicked
- Clean UI for content interaction
- Built using React class components

##  Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you will be able to:

- Handle state in React using class-based components
- Execute event handling for user interaction
- Build reusable components (e.g., Toggle)
- Create interactive and dynamic user interfaces using React
