# React Feedback Form Lab

## What I Learned

- How to create a feedback form using React functional components.
- Managing form state with the `useState` hook.
- Handling user input and form submission events.
- Validating form inputs to ensure required fields are filled.
- Using the browser's `confirm` dialog to verify user details before final submission.
- Resetting form fields and displaying a thank you message after submission.

This lab helped me gain practical experience building interactive forms and managing user inputs in React.
